# 4th-Order-High-Pass-Audio-Filter-
This project designs a 4th-order high-pass audio filter with a Bessel response, utilizing Sallen-Key and Kerwin-Huelsman-Newcomb (KHN) biquad stages to ensure minimal phase distortion, precise frequency control, and smooth high-frequency signal processing for audio applications.
